Bugs:

-occasionally, when the ball grazes the corner of a brick, the brick is destroyed but the ball velocity does not change

-the direction of the ball also does not change when the ball hits the side of a brick especially on the top row of bricks. 
i.e.: ball hits side of top level brick that is on the 2nd color, the ball goes through the brick and the brick disappears when the brick is supposed to go to the 3rd color which is the lightest shade.

-when ball is in between layers of brick, it may not bounce back and forth, but instead it goes through the brick underneath
